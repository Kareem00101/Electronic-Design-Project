"FIFo.vhd"

Entity description:
a)
- reset is used to reset the FIFO queue
- rclk is used to clock the read operation
- wclk is used to clock the write operation
- wreq indicates that there is a request to write to FIFO 
  queue
- rreq indicates that there is a request to read from FIFO 
  queue
b) datain is the vector indicating the data to be written to
the FIFO 
c) dataout is the vector indicating the data read from the FIFO
d) 
- empty indicates whether the FIFO queue is empty or not
- full indicates whether the FIFO queue is full or not

Architecture description:
the FIFO depends on the RAM and the FIFO controller hence, the 
instantiation of both components is best in order to reuse 
previously implemented components

the functionality required from FIFO is achieved using the
memory (RAM) and the FIFO controller thus, mapping the ports 
to appropriate signals in RAM and Controller gives off the 
needed functionality
