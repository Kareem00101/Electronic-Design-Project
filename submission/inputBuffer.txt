"InputBuffer.vhd"
Entity description:
a) the data_in is a vector indicating the bits
equivalent to the packet.
- data_in(7) is the parity check bit
- data_in(6 downto 3) is the data to be sent
- data_in(2 downto 0) is the address to
  be sent to
b)
- clk is the clock signal that controls the 8-bit
register
- eclk controls the clock either enables the clock
to affect the register or not 
- reset is used to reset the data_out vector 
c) data_out is a vector indicating the bits captured
by the register at rising edge of the clock

Architecture description:
since the 8-bit register (input buffer)
has asynchronous reset thus the reset has 
highest priority to check 
thus, if reset is high (reset = '1') then
data_out is of high impedance 
if reset is low then we check the second most 
prior port which is the eclk(clock_en)
at eclk low, the data_out is the same as its
current value thus no need to assign the same 
value to it again. hence, the important case is 
where  the eclk high
at the eclk high, we check on the clk for rising
edge occurrence, at rising edge the data_in bits 
gets mapped to the data_out pin
