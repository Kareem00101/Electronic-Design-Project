Entity description:
a) G is the gray vector to be converted 
b) bin is the binary vector to be evaluated 

Architecture description:
the MSB in gray vector is the same as that in the binary vector
thus, it is mapped to the MSB of the binary vector as is
since the binary and the gray vectors are of fixed number of
bits thus the conversion is done by xor-ing the bit at index
at hand (for simplicity let it be i) in binary vector with 
the bit at 'i+1' in the gray vector
