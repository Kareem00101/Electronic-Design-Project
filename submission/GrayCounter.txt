"GrayCounter.vhd"

Entity description:
a) clock is used to control when to control count_out
b) reset is used to reset count_out to the gray equivalent of
   the binary "000" 
c) enable is used to control whether the counter functions or
   not
d) count_out is the output of the counter that gets 
   incremented each rising edge of the clock at (enabled 
   no reset condition)

Architecture description:
the gray counter depends on the binary counter where the
gray value of a some decimal can be evaluated from the binary
value using basic logic gates 
where for the 3-bit signal count_out the MSB for gray is 
the same as the MSB in the binary equivalent, and generally
for the rest of the bits (other than the MSB) in gray
can be evaluated as the bit at the 'j'th position in gray is
equivalent to the xor of the 'j'th and the 'j+1'th bit in 
the binary
thus using the pre-defined entity binaryCounter we implement
the gray counter based on conversion from binary to gray 
according to previously illustrated technique by copying 
the MSB and looping over the rest of the bit XOR-ing the 
'j'th and the 'j+1'th in the binary and assigning the result
of XOR-ing them to the 'j'th bit in count_out
