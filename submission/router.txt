Entity description:
a) 
- wclock is the clock the syncs the arrival at input ports
- rst is used to reset the signal
- rclock  is the clock the syncs the service at input ports
b) datai'n' is the representation of the input signal
c) wr'n' is an indicator of whether the packet is available 
   or not 
d) datao'n' is the representation of the output signal

Architecture description:
the router module represents the integration of all the 
components (building blocks) that were previously implemented 
into the "full" system view, where the overall functionality of
routing the packets to the correct output port (based on the
address in the last two bits in the input signal) is achieved by 
connecting the input buffer,the demultiplexers, output queues
and output buffers
