"RAM.vhd"
Entity description:
a) d_in is the input vector where the ram extracts the 
   the address from
b)
- wea is the enable that controls whether the ram can write the
  address to ADDRA vector
- rea is the enable that controls whether the ram can read the 
  address from ADDRB vector
c)
- clka is the clock that controls when to write port A
- clkb is the clock that controls when to read port B
d)
- ADDRA is the vector where the ram writes the address to
- ADDRB is the vector from which the ram reads the address from
e) d_out is the vector that gets assigned specific value when
   rea signal is high and clkb at its rising edge

Architecture description:
the functionality of writing to the ram and reading from the
ram is achieved using two processes one for writing and the 
other for reading
whenever clka changes we check whether the wea is high or not
when wea is low then no write happens 
when wea is high then d_in gets mapped to the vector at the
address stored in ADDRA 
whenever clkb changes we check whether the rea is high or not
when rea is low then no read happens 
when rea is high then the 8-bit vector stored at the address
stored in ADDRB gets mapped to the d_out vector
