Entity description:
a)
- clock is used to sync the reading of the input and mapping 
  it to dout 
- reset is used to reset the RRscheduler and retunr to the 
  idle state
b)
- din1 is an input port to be read and mapped to dout 
  using clock
- din2 is an input port to be read and mapped to dout 
  using clock
- din3 is an input port to be read and mapped to dout 
  using clock
- din4 is an input port to be read and mapped to dout 
  using clock
c) RR sends a read request to FIFO/RAM telling it it's 
   read what's in that port so it should send next data
d) dout is the output port where one of the inputs get mapped
   to at rising edge of the clock synchoronusly

Architecture description:
the RoundRobin Scheduling is achieved using two concurrent 
processes on that is sensitive to the clock and reset input 
signals where when the reset is high the next state should
be s_idle and when the clock is at its rising edge the 
current state gets updated

parallel to the previous process is another that assignes the
next state signal the appropriate state based on the validity 
of the input signals din'n' and the current state
the process firstly checks the currentState for appropriate
state transition
