"binaryCounter.vhd"

Entity description:
a) 
- clk is the clock that controls when to increment d_out
- clear is used to set d_out to "000" 
- enable is used to control whether the binary counter should
  function or not
b) d_out is the output of the counter that is incremented
   whenever the clock is at its rising edge

Architecture description:
since clear has the highest priority to check; thus, whenever 
any of the signals within the sensitivity list(clk,enable,clear)
of ct process changes. we firstly check the status of the clear
signal. 
when clear signal is high, the d_out should be assigned a value
of "000"
while when clear signal is low, we check on the enable as 
when the enable is low the counter should not function
while when the enable is high, the counter should increment 
d_out each rising edge of the clk
