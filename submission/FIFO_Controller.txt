"FIFO_Controller.vhd"

Entity description:
a)
- reset is used to reset the FIFO controller
- rdclk is used to clock the read operation
- wrclk is used to clock the write operation
- r_req indicates that there is a request to read from FIFO 
  queue
- w_req indicates that there is a request to write to FIFO 
  queue
- write_valid indicates that write at the specified address is
  valid 
- read_valid indicates that read from the specified address is
  valid
- empty indicates whether the FIFO queue is empty or not
- full indicates whether the FIFO queue is full or not
- wr_ptr indicates the address to write to in the FIFO queue
- rd_ptr indicates the address to read from in the FIFO queue

Architecture description:
the fifo controller depends on gray counter and gray to binary
converter thus it depends on them to evaluate address
the contorller regularly updates the full,empty,wr_ptr,rd_ptr,
write_valid and read_valid signals

when the rd_ptr vector has the same bit value in wr_ptr
this indicates that the FIFO queue is empty
if not then the FIFO queue is not empty

when the rd_ptr vector has the same bit value as (wr_ptr + 1)
this indicates that the FIFO queue is full
if not then the FIFO queue is not full

when there is a write request and the FIFO queue is not full
the valid write indication bit (write_valid) becomes high
if not both conditions are true then the write valid is low

when there is a read request and the FIFO queue is not empty
the valid read indication bit (read_valid) becomes high
if not both conditions are true then the write valid is low
