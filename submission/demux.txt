Entity description:
a) data_in is the bits captured by the input buffer
module, it gets put into the demultiplexer in
the switch fabric module in order to be routed
to a specific FIFO queue in the following module
(output queue and buffer)
b) select_in is used as a selector to identify which
output port to map the data_in bits to 
c) enable which is used to control whether the
de-multiplexer functions or not
d) d'n'_out are output ports which map the output of
the switch fabric module to the output to 'n'th 
output queue
e) wr_sel is used as a selector that enables the 
'n'th FIFO to get enabled while others are disabled

Architecture description:
since the enable has the highest priority to check
in this module. thus, at any change in data_in,
select_in or enable ports we firstly check on 
the enable signal
at enable is low, the demultiplexer should not 
function and not FIFO queue within the next module
should be enabled thus wr_sel is assigned "0000"
while at enable high, the de-multiplexer maps
the data_in bus to the d'n'_out port based on the 
select_in signal
thus, the select_in controls which data_out port 
gets the data_in signal mapped to 
since select_in is of type std_logic_vector thus,
the cases that select_in can be are:
- select_in = "00"
    to do: 
    map data_in to d1_out 
    enable the 1st FIFO queue
- select_in = "01"
    to do: 
    map data_in to d2_out 
    enable the 2nd FIFO queue
- select_in = "10"
    to do: 
    map data_in to d3_out 
    enable the 3rd FIFO queue
- select_in = "11" 
    to do: 
    map data_in to d4_out 
    enable the 4th FIFO queue
- select_in = others
    to do:
    nothing
